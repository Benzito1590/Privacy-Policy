  						<h2>Privacy Policy</h2>
  						<h4 class="mb-5">My Facebook Page Privacy Policy</h4>

<p>This privacy policy has been compiled to better serve those who are concerned with how their ‘Personally Identifiable Information’ (PII) is being used online. PII, as described in South Africa privacy law and information security, is information that can be used on its own or with other information to identify, contact, or locate a single person, or to identify an individual in context.<br/> Please read our privacy policy carefully to get a clear understanding of how we collect, use, protect or otherwise handle your Personally Identifiable Information in accordance with my Facebook Page.<br/></p>
<h3>What personal information do we collect from the people that visit my websites?</h3></br>
<p>When viewing on my Page, as appropriate, you must message your name, your email address, your phone number or other details to help me build your website.</p>
<h3>When I do collect your information?</h3></br>
<p>I collect information from you when you message me on Facebook message or WhatsApp.</p>
<h3>How do I use your information?</h3>
<h4>I may use your information to make a website.</h4>
- <p>To personalize your website and to allow me to deliver the type of content and product offerings in which you are most interested.</p>
- <p>To allow me to better service you in responding to your customer service requests.</p>
- <p>To administer a contest, promotion, survey or other site feature.</p>
- <p>To quickly process your transactions.</p>
- <p>To ask for ratings and reviews of services or products.</p>
<h3>How do I protect your information?</h3>
- <p>I do not use vulnerability scanning and/or scanning to PCI standards.</p>
- <p>I only provide your media and information. I never ask for credit card numbers.</p>
- <p>I use regular Malware Scanning.</p>
- <p>I do not use an SSL certificate</p>
- <p>I do not need an SSL because:</p>
 <h3> When customers fill forms, they only need to submit their email and name.</p>
<h3>Do we use ‘cookies’?</h3>
- <p>We do not use cookies for tracking purposes.</p>
- <p>You can choose to have your computer warn you each time a cookie is being sent, or you can choose to turn off all cookies. You do this through your browser settings. Since browser is a little different, look at your browser’s Help Menu to learn the correct way to modify your cookies.</p>
- <p>However, you will still be able to place orders.</p>
<h3>Third-party disclosure</h3>
- <p>We do not sell, trade, or otherwise transfer to outside parties your Personally Identifiable Information unless we provide users with advance notice. This does not include website hosting partners and other parties who assist us in operating our website, conducting our business, or serving our users, so long as those parties agree to keep this information confidential. We may also release information when it’s release is appropriate to comply with the law, enforce our site policies, or protect ours or others’ rights, property or safety.</p>
- <p>However, non-personally identifiable visitor information may be provided to other parties for marketing, advertising, or other uses.</p>
<h3>Third-party links</h3>
- <p>Occasionally, at our discretion, we may include or offer third-party products or services on our website. These third-party sites have separate and independent privacy policies. We therefore have no responsibility or liability for the content and activities of these linked sites. Nonetheless, we seek to protect the integrity of our site and welcome any feedback about these sites.</p>
<h3>COPPA (Children Online Privacy Protection Act)</h3>
- <p>When it comes to the collection of personal information from children under the age of 13 years old, the Children’s Online Privacy Protection Act (COPPA) puts parents in control. The Federal Trade Commission, United States’ consumer protection agency, enforces the COPPA Rule, which spells out what operators of websites and online services must do to protect children’s privacy and safety online.</p>
- <p>We do not specifically market to children under the age of 13 years old.
<h3>Fair Information Practices</h3>
- <p>The Fair Information Practices Principles form the backbone of privacy law in the United States and the concepts they include have played a significant role in the development of data protection laws around the globe. Understanding the Fair Information Practice Principles and how they should be implemented is critical to comply with the various privacy laws that protect personal information.</p>
- <h4>In order to be in line with Fair Information Practices we will take the following responsive action, should a data breach occur:</h4>
- <p>We will notify you via email within 1 business day</p>
- <p>We will notify the users via in-site notification within 1 business day.</p>
- <p>We also agree to the Individual Redress Principle which requires that individuals have the right to legally pursue enforceable rights against data collectors and processors who fail to adhere to the law. This principle requires not only that individuals have enforceable rights against data users, but also that individuals have recourse to courts or government agencies to investigate and/or prosecute non-compliance by data processors.</p>
<h3>CAN SPAM Act</h3>
- <p>The CAN-SPAM Act is a law that sets the rules for commercial email, establishes requirements for commercial messages, gives recipients the right to have emails stopped from being sent to them, and spells out tough penalties for violations.</p>
<h4>I use your email address in order to:</h4>
- <p>Send information, respond to inquiries, and/or other requests or questions</p>
- <p>Process orders and to send information and updates pertaining to orders.</p>
- <p>Send you additional information related to your product and/or service.</p>
- <p>Market to our mailing list or continue to send emails to our clients after the original transaction has occurred.</p>
<h3>To be in accordance with CANSPAM, we agree to the following:</h3>
- <p>Not use false or misleading subjects or email addresses.</p>
- <p>Identify the message as an advertisement in some reasonable way.</p>
- <p>Include the physical address of our business or site headquarters.</p>
- <p>Monitor third-party email marketing services for compliance, if one is used.</p>
 <h3>Follow the instructions at the bottom of each email, and we will promptly remove you from ALL correspondence.</h3>
